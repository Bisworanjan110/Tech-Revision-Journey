# 🧠 OOP-Demo – C# Object-Oriented Programming Practice

This folder contains my C# practice programs focused on understanding and applying the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

1. **Encapsulation** – Using properties and methods to manage data access.
2. **Abstraction** – Hiding internal implementation and exposing necessary functionality.
3. **Inheritance** – Creating class hierarchies to reuse and extend functionality.
4. **Polymorphism** – Using method overriding and overloading to change behavior.
